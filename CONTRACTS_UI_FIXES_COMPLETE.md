# Contracts UI Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Changes Applied to `app/(dashboard)/contracts/[id]/page.tsx`

### ✅ Fixed: Supplier Contact Info Access
**Before:**
```tsx
value={supplier?.contact_info?.email || 'N/A'}
```

**After:**
```tsx
value={supplier?.email || 'N/A'}
```

**Also Added:** Phone field display
```tsx
<DetailRow
  label="Phone"
  value={supplier?.phone || 'N/A'}
/>
```

### ✅ Removed: Non-Existent Fields

#### 1. Removed `signed_date` field
- Was trying to access a field that doesn't exist in database
- Removed DatePicker and related logic

#### 2. Removed `booking_cutoff_days` field
- Was trying to access a field that doesn't exist in database
- Removed EnterpriseInlineEdit for this field

#### 3. Removed `commission_type` field
- Was trying to access a field that doesn't exist in database
- Replaced with `total_cost` field (which exists in database)

#### 4. Removed `special_terms` field
- Was trying to access a field that doesn't exist in database
- Removed EnterpriseInlineEdit for this field

### ✅ Added: Missing Useful Fields

#### Added `total_cost` field
```tsx
<div className="space-y-2">
  <label className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground">Total Cost</label>
  <EnterpriseInlineEdit
    value={contract.total_cost ? `${contract.total_cost}` : ''}
    onSave={(value) => handleUpdate('total_cost', parseFloat(value) || null)}
    placeholder="Total contract value"
  />
</div>
```

## Note on Linter Errors

There are some pre-existing TypeScript linter errors in this file that are unrelated to our schema fixes:
- Type mismatches with `StatusBadge` component
- `PageHeader` description prop issue
- Date formatting with `format()` function

These appear to be existing issues in the codebase and are not caused by our changes.
