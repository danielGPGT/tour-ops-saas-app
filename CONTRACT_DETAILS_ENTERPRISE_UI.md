# Contract Details Page - Enterprise UI Implementation

## Current State ✅

### What We Already Have:
1. ✅ **Basic Contract Details Page** (`app/(dashboard)/contracts/[id]/page.tsx`)
2. ✅ **Inline Editing** with `EnterpriseInlineEdit` component
3. ✅ **Tabbed Interface** (Overview, Details, Allocations, Rates)
4. ✅ **Allocations Section** (`ContractAllocationsSection` component)
5. ✅ **Supplier Rates Section** (`SupplierRatesSection` component)
6. ✅ **Update Functionality** via `useUpdateContract` hook

### Current Features:
- Overview tab with basic fields
- Details tab with all TEXT fields (terms, payment terms, cancellation, notes)
- Allocations tab with list view
- Rates tab
- Inline editing for contract fields
- Delete functionality

## What's Missing for Enterprise UI

### High Priority:

1. **Release Schedule Section** ❌
   - No component for allocation releases
   - Need visual timeline UI
   - Should be part of allocations or separate section

2. **Inventory Tracking Section** ❌
   - No component for allocation_inventory
   - Need real-time inventory display
   - Show total, available, sold quantities with progress bars

3. **Activity Log** ❌
   - No audit log display
   - Need to show recent changes
   - Should integrate with audit_logs table

4. **Enhanced Allocation Cards** ⚠️
   - Current: List view in table
   - Need: Expandable cards with full details
   - Need inline editing for allocation fields

5. **Better Rate Display** ⚠️
   - Current: Basic list
   - Need: Rate cards with better layout
   - Show pricing_details JSONB properly

### Medium Priority:

6. **Contract Header Enhancements**
   - Add dropdown actions (duplicate, export PDF, archive)
   - Better status badges
   - Quick stats in header

7. **Supplier Rate Cards with Multi-occupancy**
   - Display pricing_details JSONB for occupancy-based pricing
   - Edit multi-occupancy rates inline

8. **Allocation Inventory Subsection**
   - Show inventory per allocation
   - Progress bars for sold/available
   - Low stock warnings

9. **Visual Timeline for Release Schedule**
   - Timeline component for allocation_releases
   - Show release dates with penalties
   - Visual indicator for upcoming releases

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):

10. **Export PDF functionality**
11. **Duplicate contract/allocations**
12. **Contract versioning** (doesn't exist in schema)
13. **WebSocket for real-time updates**
14. **Advanced filtering/search**

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Missing Features (NOW)
1. Release Schedule component for allocation_releases
2. Inventory Tracking component for allocation_inventory
3. Enhanced Allocation Cards with expandable details

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI (NEXT)
4. Visual Timeline for Release Schedule
5. Better Rate Cards with JSONB support
6. Activity Log integration

### Phase 3: Polish (LATER)
7. Contract Header enhancements
8. Export/duplicate functionality
9. Real-time updates

## Database Tables Available

### Already in Schema:
- ✅ `contracts` - Main contract data
- ✅ `contract_allocations` - Product allocations
- ✅ `allocation_releases` - Release schedules ⭐
- ✅ `allocation_inventory` - Inventory tracking ⭐
- ✅ `supplier_rates` - Supplier pricing
- ✅ `audit_logs` - Activity tracking ⭐

### What We Need to Build:
1. Release Schedule UI component (uses `allocation_releases`)
2. Inventory Tracking component (uses `allocation_inventory`)
3. Activity Log component (uses `audit_logs`)

## Next Steps

Based on the schema analysis, we should focus on:

1. **Build Release Schedule component** - High value for hotel contracts
2. **Build Inventory Tracking component** - Essential for tracking sold/available
3. **Enhance Allocation Cards** - Better UX for managing allocations
4. **Add Activity Log** - Track changes over time

These components will make this a true "enterprise" UI that matches the requirements document.
